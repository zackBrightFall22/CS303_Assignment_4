# CS303_Assignment_4

I struggled more with this than I expected.

In class we had trees, and we practiced writing them down in the different orders. So here, we had to do the opposite and build the trees.

I haven't quite worked out if the tree produced is unique or if there is more than one correct way to answer Q1.
